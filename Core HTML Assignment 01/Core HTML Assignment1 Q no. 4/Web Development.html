    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>Web development involves creating and maintaining websites. It encompasses front-end development, which focuses on the user interface using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end development, which handles server-side logic, databases, and application integration using languages like Python, Ruby, or PHP. Web developers also work with frameworks such as React, Angular, or Django to streamline the development process. Web development requires a blend of technical skills and creativity to build responsive, user-friendly websites that perform well across various devices and browsers. Security, SEO, and performance optimization are also key considerations in the web development process.</p>
