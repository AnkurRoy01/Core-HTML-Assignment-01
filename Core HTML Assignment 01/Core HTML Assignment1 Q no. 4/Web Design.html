    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>Web design is the process of creating visually appealing and functional websites. It involves a combination of aesthetics, usability, and user experience (UX) design principles. Key elements include layout, color schemes, typography, and imagery, all of which should align with the brand's identity and goals. Responsive design is crucial, ensuring the site looks and functions well across various devices. Web designers also focus on navigation, content structure, and accessibility to make the site user-friendly. Effective web design balances creativity with practical considerations to engage users and achieve the site's objectives.</p>
